            multiple eruptions, contributing to the 
            formation of its rugged terrain and distinct 
            peaks. The Seven Peaks of Mount Apo were 
            created through volcanic activity, where 
            successive eruptions deposited layers of lava 
            and ash, shaping the mountain's structure. 
            Tectonic movements uplifted and deformed 
            the volcanic landscape, contributing to the 
            formation of these peaks. Over time, erosion 
            caused by wind, rain, and temperature 
            changes carved out distinct peaks, creating 
            the rugged terrain visible today. These peaks 
            are distinctively unique features of Apo 
            Sandawa or Mount Apo Aspiring UNESCO 
            Global Geopark. Each peak corresponds with a different altitude:  Sta. Cruz Peak is 2,949 meters above 
            sea level (masl); Bansalan Peak is 2,927 masl; Unknown peak or Center Peak is 2,951 masl; Digos City 
            Peak is 2,929 masl; Crater Peak is 2,953 masl; Davao City Peak is 2,954 masl; and Kidapawan Peak is 
            2,944 masl (Erensiya, Socio-cultural Mapping and Documentation, 2023). These are the sacred places 
            of the tribe, including the Magani or tribal warriors living along the slopes of Mount Apo.   These peaks 
            within MANP are homes of gods and goddesses who, by then, were the Sandigan ka mga Datu ka 
            Bagobo Tagabawa, or a definite place where tribal leaders leaned on for life’s security among the 
            tribe.  Thus, the creation of the name Apo Sandawa has been known (Erensiya 2023).  Indeed, the 
            peaks are the majestic mountains within MANP. Approaching the peaks, the presence of biodiversity 
            progresses. Sand-filled terrain and sizable basalt rocks are everywhere in the area. Every peak has a 
            limited area of open and level ground.  The higher altitudes are home to mossy forests and high
            altitude grasslands. When visitors reach the peak or summit, this permits them to snap pictures and 
            unwind. It towers in spectacular magnificence, its eastern face gleaming with a white covering that 
            glistens in the morning sun like a layer of snow.  An outcrop of massive andesite along the Bansalan 
            trail is observed southwest of the Summit peaks. It is characterized as porphyritic with prominent 
            phenocrysts of lath-shaped plagioclase and biotite minerals. Meanwhile, at lower elevations, some 
            farmlands offer a chance to relax in nature’s embrace. Boulders and many kinds of bushes, wild 
            berries, and other vegetation surround a certain Bansalan Peak.  
            A story unfolded about each peak where a particular god and goddess were seated and lived—the 
            Sta. Cruz Peak is home of Apo Manama, or the god of love; Bansalan Peak is home of Apo Taragume 
            or the god of water; Unknown Peak is home of Apo Anito or the god of healing; Digos City Peak is 
            home of Apo Matulus or the god the father; Crater Peak is home of Apo Manunggod or the god of 
            giving; Davao City Peak is home of Baye’t Pande or the goddess of wisdom; and Kidapawan Peak is 
            home of Apo Mandarangan or the god of bravery (Erensiya 2023). The IPs prayed directly to their 
            gods for their needs, for they believed that whenever they asked for something, they faced the peak 
            where a particular god lived, and these gods/goddesses convened together, whether to give favor or 
            not. As the Davao Peak was considered the seat or home of the goddess Bae’t Pande, believed to be 
            the source of all the tribes’ knowledge and regarded as the goddess of wisdom, the IP women who 
            were highly skilled and talented were also called by the same name as the goddess’s name. `,

            instability (Lewis, 1988). Sulfur dioxide and other gases 
            seep through the Earth’s crust, weakening surrounding 
            rock formations (Gomez & Jones, 2021). Interaction with 
            groundwater creates acidic conditions that accelerate 
            rock dissolution and erosion, leading to collapses 
            (Buenaflor, 2022). The terrain’s natural instability, 
            coupled with erosion and seismic activity, further

            According to PHIVOLCS reports, the summit of 
            Mount Apo exhibits multiple crater features, 
            each a result of past eruptions. The Old Apo 
            Crater Lake is one of these summit craters, 
            which was formed after a significant explosive 
            volcanic event. These explosions are believed

            magma with groundwater—a phenomenon 
            known as phreatomagmatic activity. This

            Research published by the Geological Society of the Philippines emphasizes the role of phreatic and 
            phreatomagmatic explosions in shaping Mount Apo’s summit. Phreatic explosions involve the sudden 
            release of steam and gases from hydrothermal systems, while phreatomagmatic explosions occur 
            when water comes into contact with hot magma, resulting in violent fragmentation. These processes

            evolved into crater lakes (Ramos & Lagmay, 2000). 
            Currently, it acts as a catchment basin of precipitated water and is considered an endorheic lake since

            accumulated over time, giving rise to its formation. 
            Located southwest of the summit, the lake lies in a 
            grassland area that acts as a local basin and is 
            believed to have formed structurally, as suggested by 
            the presence of inferred Northwest-Southeast (NW
            SE) and North/Northwest-South/Southeast (NNW
            SSE) parallel geological structures. These formations, 
            including two prominent NW-SE linear ridges, 
            indicate that tectonic activity such as faulting and 
            crustal movements may have contributed to shaping 
            the lake’s basin, consistent with Mount Apo’s 
            tectonically active  environment. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these structures represent faults or are intruded by 
            dikes. North of the lake, a solfataric vent emitting sulfurous fumes is visible along the trail. This area, 
            devoid of vegetation, exposes altered rocks on the slope within the solfataras. Its occurrence aligns 
            with the NW-SE structure, suggesting it may serve as a pathway for sulfur-rich steam to escape to the 
            surface. These interconnected features highlight the dynamic geological processes shaping Lake 
            Jordan and its surrounding landscape.`,

        description: `Lake Maag formed through volcanic and 
            tectonic activity. The lake occupies a natural basin 
            shaped by lava flows and pyroclastic deposits that 
            obstructed drainage, later filled by rainwater and 
            runoff. Seasonal water level fluctuations, driven by 
            rainfall and evaporation, contribute to its 
            hydrological dynamics. Along the EDC trail near Maag 
            Bunkhouse and Tinikaran Reforestation Area, the 
            lake is approximately 1.33 kilometers from EDC’s Site 
            G, with an estimated length of 50 meters and a width 
            of 30 meters. It is surrounded by shrubs, ferns, 
            Tinikaran, and Almaciga trees, and the area’s gently 
            sloping topography includes low hills. While no rock 
            exposures were observed during the assessment, 
            andesite rock floats were identified. `,

        description: `Lake Agco was formed through 
            hydrothermal processes linked to the area's 
            geothermal activity. The lake itself spans 
            approximately 60 meters in diameter. Beneath the 
            Earth's surface, heated rocks and magma chambers 
            interact with groundwater, which seeps through 
            faults and cracks. This process causes the water to 
            become superheated and rise, resulting in 
            geothermal vents and the hot springs that 
            characterize the lake. In addition to the main vent 
            responsible for heating the lake, several smaller vents 
            are present, particularly in the western bay. These vents release pools of sulfur-rich, boiling mud, contributing to the lake’s unique thermal landscape. 
            Their locations align with fissure-like structures associated with solfatara formations and sulfuric hot 
            springs, which extend along the Sandawa Collapse. `,

        description: ` The very steep gradient 
            and highly fractured lithology of the area are 
            significant factors contributing to these old mass 
            movements. Three prominent scars, displaying 
            distinct crescent-shaped features on a cliff face, 
            are accompanied by an accumulation of talus 
            material downslope near the summit area. This 
            accumulation is now vegetated with tall grasses, 
            indicating the passage of time since the landslide 
            events. The old landslide scarps in MANP are key 
            geological features, shaped by historic mass
            wasting events. These events involve the 
            downslope movement of large volumes of rock, 
            soil, and debris under the influence of gravity. The 
            formation of these scarps is typically linked to a 
            combination of steep slopes, volcanic activity, heavy rainfall, and tectonic forces, all of which 
            characterize the dynamic geology of Mount Apo.`,
